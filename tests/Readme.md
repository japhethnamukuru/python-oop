## Python Test Cases
---
The python `unittest` module subclasses the `TestCase` utility that makes it possibles to write tests.

All test methods must be prefixed with `test_` for the `main()` to run them automatically

- [x] [employee.py](employee.py) - A simple class the models an employee with a method to rise the salary
- [x] [main.py](main.py) - The driver program that asks for user data and instantiates the Employee class to create user objects.
- [x] [emp_tests.py](emp_tests.py) - Test cases for the Employee class.
